-True or False Quiz-
======

### Synopsis


Two players take turns answering questions - 'true' or 'false' (by clicking on either). Each game length is 10 questions, and a winner is determined by the number of correct answers accumulated in each game.


### Motivation

This quiz was made to be submitted as an assignment. The main objective (as told by my instructor at that time) was outside of the quiz itself; time management. That being said, this quiz also served as good practice in creating functions and understanding flow.


### Use Cases

⋅⋅1. Players (two of them) submit names
⋅⋅2. Start quiz
⋅⋅3. Each Player takes turns answering questions which are displayed in no particular sequence.
⋅⋅4. After answering by clicking on true or false, view next question
