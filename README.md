-True or False Quiz-
======

### Synopsis


Two players take turns answering questions - 'true' or 'false' (by clicking on either). Each game length is 10 questions, and a winner is determined by the number of correct answers accumulated in each game.


### Motivation

This quiz was made to be submitted as an assignment. The main objective (as told by my instructor at that time) was outside of the quiz itself; time management. That being said, this quiz also served as good practice in creating functions and understanding flow.


### Use Cases

1. Players (two of them) submit names.
2. Start quiz.
3. Each Player takes turns answering questions which are displayed in no particular sequence.
4. After answering by clicking on true or false, view next question.
5. Players repeat steps 3 and 4 until they've reached a total of 10 questions.
6. The Player with more correct answers, wins!


### Issues Faced

Being unfamiliar to coding, I was unable to approach the project using OOP. Fortunately, the emphasis for the quiz was solely on functionality and not aesthetic, which allowed me more time to work on the logic.

Being extremely silly was a huge part of this project. Prior to the project, I initialised git in the wrong folder and.....
that is not something I ever wish to do again.
